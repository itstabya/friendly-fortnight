# K-Means Clustering for Mice ACC Neural Populations

This repo is associated with [this](https://mubaris.com/2017-10-01/kmeans-clustering-in-python) blog post.

Forked from @mubaris.

Adapting this K_Means Clustering code to behavioural variables and their representation in mice ACC neurons. ðŸ¤ 

We're currently working on data from a generalized linear model, with the variables of left and right stimulus, reward, choice, previous choice, difficulty, and movement.
